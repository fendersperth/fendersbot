# Fender Bot

> A group project for learning and teaching via a real code base.

## Overview

Fenders Bot aims to provide a place for people to get real world experience working with other members of Fenders Perth, by creating a bot to interact with the Fenders slack network.

The project is made to allow anyone to propose or implement a new feature and should allow people to learn new technologies or experiment with all areas of an application, such as:

- Frontend
- Backend
- Testing
- Visualizations

As well as providing a place for people to hone their code skills, it also provides people the ability to work with a team using modern tools such as GitHub issues and Pull Requests.
